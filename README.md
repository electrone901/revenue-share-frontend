# NFT REVENUE SHARE

To stake and withdraw your project token (to get the NFT or burn it). 2.- To visualize all your NFT like cards(with their data: id, amount staked, period of time of staking, when your stake ends) 3. If you Click any NFT visualize all revenues like cards too(token to revenue, total amount to share, your revunue)


We allow any ERC20 Project to incentivize Long Term Holders and own their liquidity through a Revenue Share Mechanism.

- Oriented to projects that generate their own fees or earns.
Revenue Share Mechanism:
    - Stake ERC20 Token Project for a period of time and get an NFT.
    - Distribute rewards to NFT holders, proportional to how long they stake.
      using Merkle Tree-like Airdrops does.
    - NFT will be categorized based on how long their stake is. (Diamond Hand,
      Platinum Hand, Golden Hand, Silver Hand, Paper Hand).
-Loyalty Program:
    - Different NFT categories are allowed buy up to a set amount (proportional to the staked amount) of the ERC20 Project
      Token with a discount proportional to the category. Like bonding
      mechanism invented by OHM[bonding]



      I was thinking in you loyalty program. And I really think it is a nice idea. I thought that each NFT can have a category where me better category it is "Diamond Hand" for long term holders, another could be "Gold Hand" and so on. Then we can offer Discounts to buy the project token to owner of the NFT's like bonding mechanism that OHM Project created.
